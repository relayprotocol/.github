## Relay Depository

[Relay Depository](https://github.com/relayprotocol/relay-depository) represents a set of smart contracts across different chains and VM types providing an entry point to the Relay Hub. They allow users to deposit tokens into the Relay Protocol from any chain that is supported by the protocol, tokens which can then be used for executing various actions on the Relay Hub.

## üîì Relay Vaults

We started with [Vaults](https://github.com/relayprotocol/relay-vaults) which are [ERC4626](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-4626/) contracts in which Liquidity providers can deposit funds and earn yield. The yield comes from bridging activity that's happening on each of the vault's origins (L2 networks), as well as lending protocols such as Morpho or Aave.

We also include other packages that are not part of the core protocol but are used by the Relay solver, including the [periphery contracts](https://github.com/relayprotocol/relay-periphery).
