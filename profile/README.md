# Welcome to the RelayProtocol GitHub!

Weâ€™re the team behind [Relay](https://relay.link/), and weâ€™re now building the Relay Protocol as set of decentralized components. 

## ðŸ”“ Relay Vaults

We started with [Vaults](https://github.com/relayprotocol/relay-vaults) which are [ERC4626](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-4626/) contracts in which Liquidity providers can deposit funds and earn yield. The yield comes from bridging activity that's happening on each of the vault's origins (L2 networks), as well as lending protocols such as Morpho or Aave.
